# AnthaRaaga 🎶

**AnthaRaaga** is a structured, static repository of Indian classical rāgas, focusing on both **Hindustani** and **Carnatic** music systems.

The project is designed as a **data-first archive**, aiming to document rāgas in a clean, organized, and scalable format. It is intentionally built without backend dependencies and can be expanded later into multiple dimensions such as audio, analytics, APIs, or learning tools.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Create a centralized repository of rāgas
- Represent Hindustani and Carnatic rāgas in a structured format
