      <p class="hero-text">
        AnthaRaaga is a digital repository designed to document and organize
        Indian classical rāgas across the Hindustani and Carnatic music systems.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section-title">Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of AnthaRaaga is to serve as a structured, repository-first
        archive of rāgas — focusing on clarity, accuracy, and long-term
        scalability rather than instruction or performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section-title">Design Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        The project is intentionally built as a static, data-driven system.
        Rāgas are treated as structured records, not lessons, allowing the
        repository to grow across multiple dimensions in the future.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section-title">Technology</h3>
      <p>
        AnthaRaaga is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with rāga data
        stored in a structured JSON format. This approach ensures simplicity,
        transparency, and ease of future expansion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3 class="section-title">Future Scope</h3>
      <p>
        The repository is designed to evolve into richer dimensions such as
        audio references, analytical relationships, system-based comparisons,
        and API-backed access, while preserving its original structure.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title">Author</h3>
      <p>
        AnthaRaaga is created and maintained by
        <strong>Kaushik Muliya</strong> as a long-term digital archive
        exploring the structure and depth of Indian classical rāgas.
